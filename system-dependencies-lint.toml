# Lint Dependencies Configuration
# This file documents LINT system dependencies required for linting/formatting.
# These are needed in lint jobs and pre-commit hooks:
# - PowerShell: Required for PowerShell script linting (PSScriptAnalyzer)
#
# Version pinning strategy:
# - Exception: LINT dependencies may use "latest" since they don't affect library functionality
# - Rationale: Lint tools don't affect library functionality, and we want the latest linting rules.
# - These can be updated more freely than PROD/TEST dependencies.

[ubuntu]
powershell = "latest"  # PowerShell Core - version managed by Microsoft repository
                      # Exception: Uses "latest" for lint dependencies (see note above)

[macos]
powershell = "latest"  # PowerShell Core - version managed by Homebrew
                      # Exception: Uses "latest" for lint dependencies (see note above)

[windows]
# PowerShell is pre-installed on Windows CI runners, no installation needed
# Version depends on GitHub Actions runner image (not pinned)
