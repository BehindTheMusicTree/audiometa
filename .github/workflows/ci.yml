    # Tool Version Alignment Pattern:
    # All linting/formatting tools (ruff, isort, mypy, docformatter) use versions pinned in pyproject.toml.
    # This ensures CI and pre-commit hooks use the exact same tool versions, preventing
    # version drift and inconsistent formatting/linting behavior.
    # The "Verify tool versions" step validates this alignment and will fail the build if versions don't match.
    # See .cursor/rules/pre-commit.mdc for the complete pattern documentation.

    # System Dependencies Version Alignment Pattern:
    # All system dependencies (ffmpeg, flac, mediainfo, id3v2, bwfmetaedit) use versions pinned in
    # .github/system-dependencies.toml and scripts/ci/install-*.sh files.
    # This ensures CI and local development environments use the exact same tool versions, preventing
    # version drift and inconsistent test behavior across environments.
    # Installation scripts fail immediately if pinned versions are not available (no fallback),
    # ensuring strict version enforcement and making version mismatches immediately visible.
    # See .github/system-dependencies.toml for the complete configuration and version pinning strategy.
    strategy:
      # fail-fast: true (default) - cancel remaining jobs on first failure for faster feedback
      # This saves CI resources since most failures are common across all platforms
      # Individual jobs can be re-run if needed for platform-specific debugging
      matrix:
        # Pin OS versions for consistency with pinned package versions
        # Using -latest can cause package availability issues when OS versions change
        os: [ubuntu-24.04, macos-14, windows-2022]
