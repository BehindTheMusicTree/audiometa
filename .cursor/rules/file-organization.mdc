# File Organization

## Cursor Rules File Location

**All Cursor rules must be written in `.cursor/rules/` directory, not `.cursorrules` file.**

The `.cursorrules` file is deprecated. Use `.cursor/rules/` directory with `.mdc` files instead.

## Module Structure

- Keep related functionality together
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Avoid unnecessary module docstrings that just describe the file contents

## Import Organization

- Group imports logically
- Use absolute imports when possible
- Keep imports clean and minimal

## Pre-commit Hooks

All code must pass pre-commit hooks before committing:
- Code formatting (autoflake, isort, ruff-format, docformatter, ruff)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Linting (flake8)
- Assert statement check (custom hook - will fail if asserts are found)

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing to ensure all checks pass.
