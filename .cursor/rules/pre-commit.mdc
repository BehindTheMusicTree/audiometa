# Pre-commit Hooks

All code must pass pre-commit hooks before committing:

- Code formatting (trailing-whitespace, isort, ruff-format, docformatter, ruff)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Linting (ruff - replaces autoflake and flake8)
- Assert statement check (custom hook - will fail if asserts are found)

**Note:** Ruff handles unused imports/variables (replaces autoflake) and most linting rules (replaces flake8). The trailing-whitespace hook automatically removes trailing whitespace without failing. Ruff-format handles code formatting and EOF newlines automatically.

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing to ensure all checks pass.
