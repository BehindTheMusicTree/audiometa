# GitHub Feature Request Generation

## Feature Request Template Format

When generating GitHub feature requests, format them as **standalone markdown documents** that can be copied field-by-field into the GitHub feature request form template.

### Document Structure

1. **Create a separate `.md` file** (e.g., `ISSUE_<TOPIC>.md`)
2. **Include clear section headers** matching the GitHub feature request template fields
3. **Wrap field content in code blocks** for easy copying
4. **Provide instructions** at the end for form submission

### Required Elements

- **Title section**: Wrapped in code block with `[Feature]:` prefix
- **All template fields**: Each in its own section with content in code blocks
- **Code examples**: Use proper syntax highlighting (```python, etc.)
- **Checkboxes**: Use `☑` for items that should be checked
- **Instructions section**: Clear steps for copying content to GitHub

## Template Fields (in order)

1. **Title** - `[Feature]: <descriptive title>`
2. **Feature Description** - Clear, concise description of the feature (required)
3. **Problem Statement** - Related problems or frustrations (optional)
4. **Proposed Solution** - How you'd like it to work (optional)
5. **Alternatives Considered** - Other solutions considered (optional)
6. **Feature Scope** - Dropdown selection (required):
   - Core API
   - Metadata Format Support (ID3v1, ID3v2, Vorbis, RIFF)
   - Audio Format Support (MP3, FLAC, WAV)
   - CLI
   - Documentation
   - Error Handling
   - Performance
   - Other
7. **Use Case** - Example code showing usage (optional, python syntax)
8. **Compatibility Considerations** - Checkboxes (select applicable):
   - This feature would require changes to existing API
   - This feature would be backward compatible
   - This feature would require new dependencies
   - This feature would require external tools
9. **Additional Context** - Any other context, references, links (optional)

## Example Format

```markdown
# GitHub Issue: <Topic>

```

---

## Alternatives Considered:
```
<Other options evaluated>
```

---

## Feature Scope:
```
<Select one option>
```

---

## Use Case:
```python
# Example code showing usage
```

---

## Compatibility Considerations:
```
☑ <Checked items>
☐ <Unchecked items>
```

## Instructions

1. Go to the GitHub repository issues page
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Feature Request" template
4. Copy each section above into the corresponding field in the form
5. For "Compatibility Considerations", check the indicated checkboxes
